Some personal news: I’m leaving TechCrunch after an incredibly long run covering tech and startups, reporting on the French tech ecosystem and beyond.

This is a bittersweet moment for me, as I didn’t leave TechCrunch on my own terms. Regent LP, a private equity firm, acquired TechCrunch and laid off most of the international team. They thought international startup coverage wasn’t essential. I strongly disagree with that decision. But I genuinely want this team to succeed because it remains an incredibly talented group of people.

Back in 2012, I applied for an internship at TechCrunch because I truly believed in TechCrunch’s mission — technology was poised to change the world, and we needed to cover this industry rigorously.

Unlike typical newsrooms, TechCrunch is first and foremost a team of tech enthusiasts who happen to be reporters. We understand how a tech product works and have covered this industry with the right dose of skepticism, avoiding both cynicism and cheerleading.

After this 2012 internship, I essentially created a job for myself and received the internal support to pursue this dream job here in Paris. In my articles, I made private information public because I believed it was the best way to level the playing field for newcomers. I explained the ins and outs of the startup world to inspire and educate the next generation of entrepreneurs, investors and policymakers.

I’ve single-handedly built TechCrunch’s reputation in France for the past decade. Along this journey, I’ve interacted with some of the smartest people I’ve ever met. This job has been an immense pleasure for me.

After writing 3,500 articles over the past 13 years, I’ve learned that concise writing is more potent than longer writing. So, I’ll end here with a simple message: thank you for reading my articles.
