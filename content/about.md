# About

I’m a Senior Reporter at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/" target="_blank">TechCrunch</a>.

I have written over 3,500 articles on technology and tech startups and have established myself as an influential voice on the European tech scene. I have a deep background in startups, AI, fintech, privacy, security, blockchain, mobile, social and media.

With thirteen years of experience at TechCrunch, I’m one of the familiar faces of the tech publication that obsessively covers Silicon Valley and the tech industry — my career started at TechCrunch when I was 21. Based in Paris, many people in the tech ecosystem consider me as the most knowledgeable tech journalist in town.

I like to spot important startups before anyone else. I was the first person to cover Revolut, Alan and N26. I have written scoops on large acquisitions from Apple, Microsoft and Snap.

When I’m not writing, I’m also a developer — I understand how the tech behind the tech works. I also have a deep historical knowledge of the computer industry for the past 50 years. I know how to connect the dots between innovations and the effect on the fabric of our society.

I graduated from Emlyon Business School, a leading French business school specialized in entrepreneurship. I have helped several non-profit organizations, such as StartHer, an organization that promotes education and empowerment of women in technology, and Techfugees, an organization that empowers displaced people with technology.
