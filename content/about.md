# About

I’m a VC investor at <a href="https://www.drysdale.vc">Drysdale Ventures</a> based in Paris. We invest up to €500k as business angels, starting from day 0, and following on next rounds. Our focus areas include fintech & DeFi, infrastructure & tooling, consumer & gaming, and business solutions, with artificial intelligence as a transversal expertise.

Before joining Drysdale Ventures, I was a Senior Reporter at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/" target="_blank">TechCrunch</a> for 13 years. I wrote over 3,500 articles on technology and tech startups and established myself as an influential voice on the European tech scene. My career started at TechCrunch when I was 21.

When I’m not investing or writing, I’m also a developer — I understand how the tech behind the tech works. I also have a deep historical knowledge of the computer industry for the past 50 years. I know how to connect the dots between innovations and the effect on the fabric of our society.

I graduated from Emlyon Business School, a leading French business school specialized in entrepreneurship. I have also helped several non-profit organizations, such as StartHer, an organization that promotes education and empowerment of women in technology, and Techfugees, an organization that empowers displaced people with technology.
